## Requirements

To run some of the solutions, you may need to install the appropriate tools or libraries. Depending on the programming language, you might need:

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Python (installed with `pip`)
- Libraries such as NumPy (for Python) or standard C++ libraries

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/algorithm-solutions.git
    cd algorithm-solutions
    ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate language folder (e.g., `C++`, `Python`) and select the solution you want to run.

3. Compile or run the script according to the language requirements:
    - For C++:
        ```bash
        g++ main.cpp -o main
        ./main
        ```
    - For Python:
        ```bash
        python3 main.py
        ```

## Repository Structure


Each task folder contains a README.md file with a problem description and an explanation of the solution.
